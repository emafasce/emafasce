### Hello World, I am Emanuele ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently detecting malwares through machine learning at Sysdig in Milan, using mainly Python and working with Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes and Prometheus.

I completed the Msc in Data Science and Engineering at Polytechnic of Turin in April 2022, graduating with 110/110 with honors, focusing on machine learning and big data.

From January 2021 to June 2021 I carried out my master degree thesis in computer vision for defect detection at Luxottica, Agordo.
